# Locked and Loded
## Description
Locked and Loded is a top-down 2D shooter game. There will be areas of different magnetic fields either pointing out of or into the screen, as well as walls and pits to stop the player, enemies, or bullets from moving into specific areas. Both the player and enemies will be able to shoot different projectiles such as an electron, proton, or a conducting loop, each with distinct properties. The magnetic fields will influence the trajectories of these projectiles. The goal of this game would be to destroy all of the enemies with a limited amount of projectiles.
